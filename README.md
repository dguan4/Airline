# Airline

Airline simulator for a class. 

## Contents and Usage

Most of the files are contained in the Data folder. Simply run the console.py file to run the simulation.

This simulation loads up a preset airport flight through a JSON file and allows you to configure things to your liking, such as adding cities and routes. Console's interface is self explanatory.
